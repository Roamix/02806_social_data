						<h2>Motivation</h2>

						<p>
							The datasets we have choosen for our project are the NYPD Motor-Vehicle-Collision and the NY NOAA Weather dataset:
							<ul type="circle">
								<li><a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Motor-Vehicle-Collisions/h9gi-nx95" >data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Motor-Vehicle-Collisions</a></li>
								<li><a href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datasets">www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datasets</a></li>
							</ul>
							The NYPD dataset contains over 1 million rows of data with multiple rows of same date value and 29 features, with the
							NOAA dataset containing the same amount of rows as dates in the NYPD dataset and 4 features.
						</p>

						<p>
							Motivation for this project started with the idea of cross referencing the NY vehicle accident dataset
							with the NY weather dataset, and see how much of the data correlates to the number of accidents and type of accidents.
							With this data we hoped that certain trends would emerge visually and give an overview of the most dangerous areas in NY
							with regard to the traffic. This means we could potentially help warn trafficants of accident prone areas
							and be extra vigilant.
						</p>
						<p>
							Our end goal was to have the user explore the data with regard to seasonal weather and the accidents in the different boroughs.
							We put more focus on a visualized dashboard rather than a narrative story since we hope that seeing how and why accidents happen
							in the different boroughs would send a message of driving accordingly to the weather conditions.

				<!-- Part 2: Basic stats -->
				<div class="spotlight">

						<h2>Basic stats</h2>

						<p>
							Starting with the NYPD dataset containing traffic collisions we ran a check of data completeness in python with the pandas library,
							to see how much data was missing from each feature. Here we see the first 7 features in which we concentrated on making a complete dataset.
						</p>

						<ul type="circle">
							<li>DATE is 100.00% complete</li>
							<li>TIME is 100.00% complete</li>
							<li>BOROUGH is 71.36% complete</li>
							<li>ZIP CODE is 71.35% complete</li>
							<li>LATITUDE is 82.57% complete</li>
							<li>LONGITUDE is 82.57% complete</li>
							<li>LOCATION is 82.57% complete</li>
						</ul>

						<p>
							As we see, latitude and longitude has around 17.5% missing data. The dataset is filtered by removing all rows where the data is not complete,
							In this case we remove all observations with latitude or longitude missing.
						</p>

						<ul type="circle">
							<li>DATE is 100.00% complete</li>
							<li>TIME is 100.00% complete</li>
							<li>BOROUGH is 83.08% complete</li>
							<li>ZIP CODE is 83.08% complete</li>
							<li>LATITUDE is 100.00% complete</li>
							<li>LONGITUDE is 100.00% complete</li>
							<li>LOCATION is 100.00% complete</li>
						</ul>

						<p>
							This is repeated with zip code and borough, such that we only work with observations that do not miss borough, zip code, or latitude/longitude.
							Similar processing is applied to the NOAA weather data, such that we only keep observations for the same dates that we also have collison data on.
							As we found out later, the data actually need further scrutiny, since as "Main accident factors" (See Data story) in the NYPD dataset
							contained empty values ' ' and 'Unspecified'. These values are in of itself also data but it turned out to classify
							almost a 1/4 of the NYPD data and does then not properly explain the reason of the accident. Whether or not to keep
							this data is hard to evaluate but as of now we have decided to keep it. This shows atleast that for all the incidents
							alot of them have not been properly recorded in the dataset and can be a cause of wrongly skewed data.
						</p>
						<p>
							After all the preprocessing we ended up with a total of <b>425.992</b> observations/data points.

						<h2>Visualizations</h2>

						<p>
						As we explained in the motivation, we put a heavy focus on a comprehensive and interactive
						visualization dashboard. We wanted to have a dashboard where the user was free to play around and explore for them selves.
						We decided for the following visualizations on the dashboard:
						<ul>
							<li>Donut chart</li>
							<li>Bar chart</li>
							<li>Choropleth</li>
							<li>Timeline (Bar chart)</li>
						</ul>
						Furhtermore, we wanted ALL the figures to interact with each other, such that the user has maximum ability to filter and explore the data.
						We chose these four different charts, because they cover most of the visualization types we learned about in this course.

						<h2>Discussion</h2>

						<p>dc, crossfilter, reason = performance opti,ization and eeasier implementation, missing stacked bar chart -> injured killed,
						initially tried to plot all accidents as points on ny map, missing visualising weather data,
						filtered after location;zipcodes or boroughs,
