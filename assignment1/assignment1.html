            ## FORMALIA ##
            * Setup the entire assingment on a single page.
            * Style it nicely using CSS.
            * Use h2 tags to seperate each "Part".
            * Put everything in a .zip file, including external dependencies
              such as data, style-sheets, js scripts, etc.

            ## RECOMMENDATIONS ##
            * Repeat the question you are answering to help the reader navigate.
            * Control the lenght of answers. Write clearly and succinct.
            * Read the text carefully and make sure every question is answered.
            * Format plots proper. Axes must be labled, and accommodating text
              that explains every figure.
            * Insert references when needed and follow academic standards.
            * Write in objective language, i.e. avoid "I think...",
              "In my opinion... ", etc.
            * If an observation is made, support it with data.

            ## HANDIN ##
            * Upload the assignment to http://peergrade.io/
            * The upload can have any name.
            * Double check that everything works after having uploadet to
              peergrade. Download the files and double check.

        <h2>Part 1: DAOST Chapter 2 Questions</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Explain in your own words the point of the jitter plot.</li>
                <li>Explain in your own words the point of figure 2-3. (I'm going to skip saying "in your own words" going forward, but I hope you get the point; I expect all answers to be in your own words).</li>
                <li>The author of DAOST (Philipp Janert) likes KDEs (and think they're better than histograms). And I don't. I didn't give a detailed explanation in the video, but now that works to my advantage. I'll ask you guys to think about this and thereby create an excellent exercise: When can KDEs be misleading?</li>
                <li>I've discussed some strengths of the CDF - there are also weaknesses. Janert writes "[CDFs] have less intuitive appeal than histograms of KDEs". What does he mean by that?</li>
                <li>What is a Quantile plot? What is it good for.</li>
                <li>How is a Probablity plot defined? What is it useful for? Have you ever seen one before?</li>
                <li>One of the reasons I like DAOST is that Janert is so suspicious of mean, median, and related summary statistics. Explain why one has to be careful when using those - and why visualization of the full data is always better.</li>
                <li>I love box plots. When are box plots most useful?</li>
                <li>The book doesn't mention violin plots. Are those better or worse than box plots? Why?</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Part 2: DAOST Chapter 3 Questions</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Looking at Fig 3-1, Janert writes "the data itself shows clearly that the amount of random noise in the data is small". What do you think his argument is?</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Janert's argument: <cite>"... the data points fall on a relatively smooth curve, and we can have confidence that it represents the data accurately."</cite>
                            The data points have very little deviation from the underlying curve, which means little random noise in the positions of the data points.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>Can you think of a real-world example of a multivariate relationship like the one in Fig 3-3 (lower right panel)?</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li></li>
                    </ul>
                <li>What are the two methods Janert metions for smoothing noisy data? Can you think of other ones?</li>
                    <ol type="1">
                        <li><i>Weighted splines</i></li>
                        <li><i>LOESS</i></li>
                        <li>...</li>
                    </ol>
                <li>What are residuals? Why is it a good idea to plot the residuals of your fit?</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The residuals are difference between the true target values and the approximations. I.e. the error.
                        It is a good idea to plot the residuals to see if:</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>the residuals are symmetrically distributed around zero.</li>
                                <li>the residuals are free of trend or structure. If there is a trend in the residuals, it suggests that the model fails to capture some information.</li>
                                <li>the residuals have constant variance and a mean around zero.</li>
                                <li>the residuals are normally distributed.</li>
                            </ul>
                    </ul>
                <li>Explain in your own words the point of the smooth tube in figure 3-7.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The <i>"smooth tube"</i> functions as a confidence interval along the approximation curve.
                            At the same time it illustrates intervals along the curve where the residuals are large.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>What kind of relationships will a semi-log plot help you discover?</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>...</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>What kind of functions will loglog plots help you see?</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>...</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>What the h#ll is banking and what element from our visual system does it use to help us see patterns? What are potential problems with banking?</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Banking is a transformation that is not applied to the data, but to the plots themselves by changing the aspect ratio. The purpose is to make <i>changes</i> and curves more recognizeable.
                            It does this by appealing to humans affinity of proportions of 4 by 3. Problems occur when the banking makes the aspect ratio too skewed, or when the banking makes
                            the plot lose too much detail by shrinking the axes.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>I think figure 3-14 makes an important point about linear fits that is rarely made. What is it?</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>...</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>Summarize the discussion of Graphical Analysis and Presentation Graphics on pp. 68-69 in your own words.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>...</li>
