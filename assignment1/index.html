							<h2>DAOST Chapter 2 Questions</h2>
							<h3>Purpose of a jitter plot.</h3>

							<p>
								The purpose of a jitter plot is to separate data-sets that occupies the same space. By doing this we get a better view of how much of the data occupies the same space. There is no correlation between the distance of the points on the y-axis.
							</p>

							<h3>The purpose of figure 2-3</h3>
							<p>
								Figure 2-3 from <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596802363.do">DAOST</a> - shown below - illustrates two different historams visualizing the same (relatively small) dataset.
							</p>

							<img src="/assignment1/images/fig23.png" alt="" height="100%" width="100%"/>

							<p>
								The purpose of this figure is to show that no two histograms are created equal: When working with small data sets, not only do we need to carefully consider how many bins the histogram is constructed with, but also how the bins are alligned on the x-axis.<br />
								Small data sets are prone to being skewed by bin allignment especially with non-gaussian distribution. The figure caption might as well be <i>how not to histogram.</i>
							</p>

							<h3>When can KDEs be misleading?</h3>

							Kernel Density Estimates (KDEs) are conceivably better than histograms at representing and retaining the integrity of certain data sets. Handling outliers, lack of bin size / allignement and unabridged representation  gives them an advantage over histograms in many cases.

							However, KDEs have some disadvantage which can be seen on figure 2-4 (the count is not accurate)

							<!-- The author of DAOST (Philipp Janert) likes KDEs (and think they're better than histograms). And I don't. I didn't give a detailed explanation in the video, but now that works to my advantage. I'll ask you guys to think about this and thereby create an excellent exercise: When can KDEs be misleading? -->

							<h3>I've discussed some strengths of the CDF - there are also weaknesses. Janert writes "[CDFs] have less intuitive appeal than histograms of KDEs". What does he mean by that?</h3>
							<h3>What is a Quantile plot? What is it good for.</h3>
							<h3>How is a Probablity plot defined? What is it useful for? Have you ever seen one before?</h3>
							<h3>One of the reasons I like DAOST is that Janert is so suspicious of mean, median, and related summary statistics. Explain why one has to be careful when using those - and why visualization of the full data is always better.</h3>
							<h3>I love box plots. When are box plots most useful?</h3>
							<h3>The book doesn't mention violin plots. Are those better or worse than box plots? Why?</h3>

			            <ul>
			                <li>Looking at Fig 3-1, Janert writes "the data itself shows clearly that the amount of random noise in the data is small". What do you think his argument is?</li>
			                    <ul>
			                        <li>Janert's argument: <cite>"... the data points fall on a relatively smooth curve, and we can have confidence that it represents the data accurately."</cite>
			                            The data points have very little deviation from the underlying curve, which means little random noise in the positions of the data points.</li>
			                    </ul>
			                <li>Can you think of a real-world example of a multivariate relationship like the one in Fig 3-3 (lower right panel)?</li>
			                    <ul>
			                        <li></li>
			                    </ul>
			                <li>What are the two methods Janert metions for smoothing noisy data? Can you think of other ones?</li>
			                    <ol type="1">
			                        <li><i>Weighted splines</i></li>
			                        <li><i>LOESS</i></li>
			                        <li>...</li>
			                    </ol>
			                <li>What are residuals? Why is it a good idea to plot the residuals of your fit?</li>
			                    <ul>
			                        <li>The residuals are difference between the true target values and the approximations. I.e. the error.
			                        It is a good idea to plot the residuals to see if:</li>
			                            <ul>
			                                <li>the residuals are symmetrically distributed around zero.</li>
			                                <li>the residuals are free of trend or structure. If there is a trend in the residuals, it suggests that the model fails to capture some information.</li>
			                                <li>the residuals have constant variance and a mean around zero.</li>
			                                <li>the residuals are normally distributed.</li>
			                            </ul>
			                    </ul>
			                <li>Explain in your own words the point of the smooth tube in figure 3-7.</li>
			                    <ul>
			                        <li>The <i>"smooth tube"</i> functions as a confidence interval along the approximation curve.
			                            At the same time it illustrates intervals along the curve where the residuals are large.</li>
			                    </ul>
			                <li>What kind of relationships will a semi-log plot help you discover?</li>
			                    <ul>
			                        <li>...</li>
			                    </ul>

			                    </ul>
			                <li>What the h#ll is banking and what element from our visual system does it use to help us see patterns? What are potential problems with banking?</li>
			                    <ul>
			                        <li>Banking is a transformation that is not applied to the data, but to the plots themselves by changing the aspect ratio. The purpose is to make <i>changes</i> and curves more recognizeable.
			                            It does this by appealing to humans affinity of proportions of 4 by 3. Problems occur when the banking makes the aspect ratio too skewed, or when the banking makes
			                            the plot lose too much detail by shrinking the axes.</li>
			                    </ul>
			                <li>I think figure 3-14 makes an important point about linear fits that is rarely made. What is it?</li>
			                    <ul>
			                        <li>...</li>
